  Promtail is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private Loki
  instance or Grafana Cloud. It is usually
  deployed to every machine that has applications needed to be monitored.

  It primarily:

  1. Discovers targets
  2. Attaches labels to log streams
  3. Pushes them to the Loki instance.

  Currently, Promtail can tail logs from two sources: local log files and the
  systemd journal (on AMD64 machines only).
